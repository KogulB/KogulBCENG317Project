### Week 8
#### Oct 23, 2018

 # Today in class I started doing some quick research on how to wire my PCF8591 to the 
 bred board so that it could connect to my Rpi 3. I attempted to connect my Rpi to the breadboard which had my IC mounted using alligator clippers. 
 After further explanation from my instructor I was told that using alligator clips could essentially damage my “pie” as the clips were too close together and touching. 
 I decided I was going to finish the rewiring at home with the proper wires that came with the chip. 
 My next step was to locate a Display adapter, so I could do a proper setup of NOOBs on the Rpi 3. 
 This was also not successful due to my file being corrupt, and I will be including a screenshot of the setup I created at home with works with proper functionality. 
 According to my schedule I created I am on time when it comes to completing the breadboard milestone but lagging on other items for the project such as PI setup. 
 I was able to successfully prove through the command I2cdetect that I am using the correct bus that I chose in the beginning of the term.
