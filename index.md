##### Soldered Board

Today in class I started working on soldering my PCB board in order to be able to attach to the Rpi 3.
I ran into some trouble as I did not have any stackable header pins of my own but was able to find some extra ones in the Prototype Lab.
The soldering was a bit difficult for me as I did not have any prior experience in doing it myself.
I had trouble figuring out what temperature to use to make sure the solder actually stuck.
My collegue and instructor were able to point me in the right direction and help me solder the board successfully.
After soldering I made sure everything was fine with my board by getting a second opinon as well as checking it under the microscope.
I was able to plug in my sensor to my board and my boardto my development platform which in turn caused a light to illuminate on the sensor.
Further testing will be done by applying the I2cdetect command. As I have fully completed my soldering diagram today I am still on track with my
[project schedule](https://github.com/KogulB/KogulBCENG317Project/blob/master/documentation/Schedule.mpp).
My [Budget Calculation]( is still roughly the same as I was able to find the pins I needed in the ProtoType Lab.
 


### Week 9

#### October 30, 2018

In class I worked on further developing my fritzing diagram so I was able to get a PCB printout.
I ran into some trouble with my diagram as it was not accurate enough to be able to create
a PCB board. Looking back at last years project Student Sense Hat I was able to reference my IC
as my PCF8591 was used in that project. With some help from the instructor I was able to figure out how to do the correct version of my fritzing diagram and complete my PCB layout successfully here are screenshots of my completed layout, breadboard and schematic:

### Week 8
#### Oct 23, 2018

 Today in class I started doing some quick research on how to wire my PCF8591 to the 
 bread board so that it could connect to my Rpi 3. I attempted to connect my Rpi to the breadboard which had my IC mounted using alligator clippers. 
 After further explanation from my instructor I was told that using alligator clips could essentially damage my “pie” as the clips were too close together and touching. 
 I decided I was going to finish the rewiring at home with the proper wires that came with the chip. 
 My next step was to locate a Display adapter, so I could do a proper setup of NOOBs on the Rpi 3. 
 This was also not successful due to my file being corrupt, and I will be including a screenshot of the setup I created at home with works with proper functionality. 
 According to my schedule I created I am on time when it comes to completing the breadboard milestone but lagging on other items for the project such as PI setup. 
 I was able to successfully prove through the command I2cdetect that I am using the correct bus that I chose in the beginning of the term.
